abstract = {Smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) was invented to simulate nonaxisymmetric phenomena in astrophysics (Lucy 1977, Gingold {\&} Monaghan 1977). We wanted a method that was easy to work with and could give reasonable accuracy. The SPH method satisfied these require- ments. As a bonus we found the SPH was rugged, gave sensible answers in difficult situations, and could be extended to complicated physics with- out much trouble. The SPH method is a particle method. Unlike the particle in cell method (PIC) (Harlow 1957, 1974, 1988), SPH does not need a grid to calculate spatial derivatives. Instead, they are found by analytical differentiation of interpolation formulae. The equations of momentum and energy become sets of ordinary differential equations which are easy to understand in mechanical and thermodynamical terms. For example, the pressure gradi- ent becomes a force between pairs of particles. The astrophysicist can then use intuition in a way which is difficult with the original partial differential equations. This intuition, coupled with detailed analysis, has allowed SPH to be extended to a wide variety of astrophysical problems. Although very accurate finite-difference methods exist-and these are better than SPH for some problems-they cannot handle complex physics in three dimensions with the same ease. Various aspects of SPH have been reviewed by Monaghan (1985, 1988a) and Benz (1988, 1989).},

   abstract = {In this paper an SPH version of the alpha turbulence model devised by Holm and his colleagues is formulated for compressible flow with a resolution that varies in space and time. The alpha model involves two velocity fields. One velocity field is obtained from the momentum equation, the other by averaging this velocity field as in the version of SPH called XSPH. The particles (fluid elements) are moved with the averaged velocity. In analogy to the continuum alpha model we obtain a particle Lagrangian from which the SPH alpha equations can be derived. The system satisfies a discrete Kelvin circulation theorem identical to that obtained with no velocity averaging. In addition, the energy, linear and angular momentum are conserved. We show that the continuum equivalent of the SPH equations are identical to the continuum alpha model, and we conjecture that they will have the same desirable features of the continuum modelincluding the reduction of energy in the high wave number modes even when the dissipation is zero. Regardless of issues concerning turbulence modelling, the SPH alpha model is a powerful extension of the XSPH algorithm which reduces disorder at short length scales and retains the constants of the motion. The SPH alpha model is simple to implement.},

Non-overtopping and overtopping of the breakwater by the incident wave were considered to compare different wave dissipation efficiencies. An incompressible Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) theory combined with a Large Eddy Simulation (LES) model was employed as the numerical tool. The SPH method is robust for tracking free surfaces without numerical diffusion and the LES model is capable of analyzing turbulence and eddy vortices during wave-breakwater interactions. A good agreement between computational and experimental wave profiles verifies the accuracy of the SPH-LES model. The computations also disclose that the wave energy dissipation is mainly attributed to the turbulence production and vortex shedding during the wave transmission and reflection processes.},

   abstract = {Context. Simulations of astrophysical turbulence have reached such a level of sophistication that quantitative results are now starting to emerge. However, contradicting results have been reported in the literature with respect to the performance of the numerical techniques employed for its study and their relevance to the physical systems modelled.Aims. We aim at characterising the performance of a variety of hydrodynamics codes including different particle-based and grid-based techniques on the modelling of decaying supersonic turbulence. This is the first such large-scale comparison ever conducted.Methods. We modelled driven, compressible, supersonic, isothermal turbulence with an rms Mach number of Mms̃4, and then let it decay in the absence of gravity, using runs performed with four different grid codes (ENZO, FLASH, TVD, ZEUS) and three different SPH codes (GADGET, PHANTOM, VINE). We additionally analysed two calculations denoted as PHANTOM A and PHANTOM B using two different implementations of artificial viscosity in PHANTOM. We analysed the results of our numerical experiments using volume-averaged quantities like the rms Mach number, volume-and density-weighted velocity Fourier spectrum functions, and probability distribution functions of density, velocity, and velocity derivatives.Results. Our analysis indicates that grid codes tend to be less dissipative than SPH codes, though details of the techniques used can make large differences in both cases. For example, the Morris & Monaghan viscosity implementation for SPH results in less dissipation (PHANTOM B and VINE versus GADGET and PHANTOM A). For grid codes, using a smaller diffusion parameter leads to less dissipation, but results in a larger bottleneck effect (our ENZO versus FLASH runs). As a general result, we find that by using a similar number of resolution elements N for each spatial direction means that all codes (both grid-based and particle-based) show encouraging similarity of all statistical quantities for isotropic supersonic turbulence on spatial scales k≥N/32 (all scales resolved by more than 32 grid cells), while scales smaller than that are significantly affected by the specific implementation of the algorithm for solving the equations of hydrodynamics. At comparable numerical resolution (Nparticles≈ Ncells), the SPH runs were on average about ten times more computationally intensive than the grid runs, although with variations of up to a factor of ten between the different SPH runs and between the different grid runs.Conclusions. At the resolutions employed here, the ability to model supersonic to transonic flows is comparable across the various codes used in this study. © 2009 ESO.},

   abstract = {The aim of this paper is to describe a turbulence model for the particle method Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH). The model makes few assumptions, conserves linear and angular momentum, satisfies a discrete version of Kelvin's circulation theorem, and is computationally efficient. Furthermore, the results from the model are in good agreement with the experimental and computational results of Clercx and Heijst for two-dimensional turbulence inside a box with no-slip walls. The model is based on a Lagrangian similar to that used for the Lagrangian averaged NavierStokes (LANS) turbulence model, but with a different smoothed velocity. The smoothed velocity preserves the shape of the spectrum of the unsmoothed velocity, but reduces the magnitude for short length scales by an amount which depends on a parameter ε. We call this the SPH- model. The effectiveness of the model is indicated by the fact that the second and fourth order velocity correlation functions calculated using the smoothed velocity and a coarse resolution, are in good agreement with a calculation using a resolution which is finer by a factor 2, and therefore requires 8 times as much work to integrate to the same time. © 2011 Elsevier Masson SAS.

   abstract = {Direct evaluation of energy spectra in purely Lagrangian meshless methods is a challenging task. On the other hand, improvement of turbulence modeling in a Lagrangian framework relies strongly on our ability to estimate energy spectra up to the maximally resolved wavenumber. In this paper we compare different strategies to extract energy spectra from a velocity field defined on a scattered set of points. Spectra can be directly evaluated from irregularly distributed sample by using Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) and their regularized versions. Alternative procedures require a preliminary interpolation into a grid where, on a second stage, a Fourier analysis can be performed. As a last approach a Moving Least Squares (MLSs) technique for preliminary interpolation is investigated and the results are discussed. Although exhibiting good accuracy in the low-moderate wavenumber window, the first two strategies introduce unacceptable large errors in the near-maximal-resolved wavenumber, where the highest accuracy is often required. Here we propose a second-order Moving Least Squares (MLSs) scheme as an optimal tool that allows us to reproduce precisely the energy spectrum over the entire wavenumber window. We discuss the importance of this result with respect to the development of accurate turbulence models for purely Lagrangian meshless methods. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

   abstract = {This thesis investigates turbulent wall-bounded flows using the Smoothed Particle Hydro- dynamics (SPH) method. The first part focuses on the SPH method itself in the context of the Navier-Stokes equations with a special emphasis on wall boundary conditions. After dis- cussing classical wall boundary conditions a detailed introduction to unified semi-analytical wall boundary conditions is given where the key parameter is a renormalization factor that accounts for the truncated kernel support in wall-bounded flows. In the following chapter it is shown that these boundary conditions fulfill energy conser- vation only approximately. This leads to numerical noise which, interpreted as form of Brownian motion, is treated using an additional volume diffusion term in the continuity equation where it is shown to be equivalent to an approximate Riemann solver. Two exten- sions to the boundary conditions are presented dealing with variable driving forces and a generalization to Robin type and arbitrary-order interpolation. Two modifications for free- surface flows are then presented, one for the volume diffusion term and the other for the algorithm that imposes Robin boundary conditions. The variable driving force is validated using a Poiseuille flow and the results indicate an error which is five orders of magnitude smaller than with the previous formulation. Discretising the wave equation with Robin boundary conditions proves that these are correctly imposed and that increasing the order of the interpolation decreases the error. The two modifications for flows under the influence of external forces significantly reduce the error at the free-surface. Finally, a dam break over a wedge demonstrates the capabilities of all the proposed modifications. With the aim of simulating turbulent flows in channels, the thesis moves on to extending the unified semi-analytical wall-boundary conditions to three dimensions. The thesis first presents the consistent computation of the vertex particle mass. Then, the computation of the kernel renormalization factor is considered, which in 3-D consists of solving an integral over a two dimensional manifold where the smoothing kernel intersects the boundary. Us- ing a domain decomposition algorithm special integration areas are obtained for which this integral can be solved for the 5th-order Wendland kernel. This algorithm is successfully applied to several validation cases including a dam break with an obstacle which show a significant improvement compared to other approximative methods and boundary condi- tions. The second part of this thesis investigates turbulent flows, in particular turbulent channel flow. This test case is introduced in detail showing both the physical properties as well as established numerical methods such as direct numerical simulation (DNS) and large eddy simulation (LES). In the penultimate chapter several SPH simulations of the turbulent channel flow are shown. The first section deals with a quasi DNS of the minimal-flow unit, a channel flow with a minimal domain size to sustain turbulent flow structures. The Eulerian statistics are compared to literature and show good agreement except for some wall-normal quantities. Furthermore, preliminary Lagrangian statistics are shown and com- pared to results obtained from a mesh-based DNS. The final simulation shows a LES of a full-sized channel at Reynolds number Reτ = 1000. The Eulerian statistics are compared to literature and the discrepancies found are explained using simulations of the Taylor-Green vortex, indicating that the momentum is not transferred appropriately due to an unresolved velocity-pressure-gradient tensor.},

   abstract = {The turbulent flow field through complex geometric configurations involves interactions between wakes, von K´arm´an vortex streets and shear layers. The mechanisms involved in both vortex loss of coherence and vortex interaction with cylinders require the identification of vortexes themselves. One of the most promising techniques, especially for essentially two-dimensional structures, is based on the definition of Lagrangian Coherent Structures (LCS). SPH is a particularly attractive method for the study of LCS since the technique itself provides the motion of individual fluid particles. This eliminates the need for expensive post-processing inherent to Eulerian solutions. SPH solutions may resolve large turbulent scales, however, dynamics of small scales and dissipative effects must be modelled for high Re flows. The typically employed SPS strategy for LES simulations, based on the standard Smagorinsky model, has severe downsides such as inability to correctly enforce wall conditions and non-vanishing stresses with laminar flows. As an alternative, the wall-adapting local eddy viscosity (WALE) model is cast in SPH formalism and used to perform the simulations under DualSPHysics, retaining the high-performance of the implementation. The results are drawn from 2D LES simulations on a cylinder array at Re=550. They allow for a brief and exploratory characterization of the used SPH formulation (weakly compressible) regarding its ability to resolve the flow at kernel and sub-kernel scales. A complex LCS system is studied in detail, showing the life of a group of eddies as they undergo changes due to interactions with each other, background turbulence and the channel geometry.},

   abstract = {In the present work the multi-phase SPH model presented in Grenier et al. (2009) is considered and extended through the inclusion of a diffusive term in the continuity equation. The latter based on the δ-SPH model of Antuono et al. (2012), allows to improve the evaluation of the pressure field, removing numerical noise and improving also the particles spatial distribution. The time stepping and the choice of the speeds of sound for the different phases are discussed, showing that this choice is driven not only by physical consideration but also by numerical constraints linked to the stability of the scheme. To this aim, comparisons are provided to a Riemann–SPH multi-phase model. In particular we show that the proposed δ-SPH multi-phase solver has a different stability region than its Riemann–SPH counterpart, allowing for bigger time steps for some density and speed of sound ratios, while in other conditions the Riemann–SPH multi-phase model is more convenient. A series of validating tests are carried out over different benchmarks widely used in the SPH literature. As a final test-case the water entry of a corrugated panel involving the entrapment of an air cavity is considered to show how the proposed multi-phase δ-SPH method is able to accurately treat complex water impact events.},

@article{Wang2020,
   abstract = {In this paper an Incompressible Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (ISPH) method solving the 2D RANS (Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes) equations with the k–ε turbulence closure is constructed. In the present model, the concept of “massless ISPH” utilizing the definition of “particle density” (number of computational particles within unit volume) is stressed. The skills of this numerical model are tested by applying to two laboratory experiments: (1) A non-breaking solitary wave propagating over a bottom-mounted barrier and (2) a solitary wave breaking on a 1 on 50 slope. In the former case flow separation occurs behind the barrier as the wave crest passes by and a vortex is generated, which later interacts with free surface causing breaking. In the latter case wave breaking and bottom friction both generate significant turbulence. For both cases, the effects of initial seeding of turbulent kinetic energy, required in the k–ε model, are studied and it is concluded that initial values of O (10−10) to O (10−8) m2/s2 should be used. An adaptive wall boundary condition for k–ε turbulence model is employed to avoid the unrealistic production of turbulence near the wall boundary. The numerical results, in terms of free surface profile, mean velocity field, vorticity field, turbulent kinetic energy and turbulent shear stress, are compared with experimental data. Very reasonable agreement is observed. This paper presents the first comprehensively validated 2D ISPH model with the k–ε turbulence closure, which can be applied to transient free surface wave problems.},

@article{Woodward2021,
   abstract = {Smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) is a mesh-free Lagrangian method for obtaining approximate numerical solutions of the equations of fluid dynamics; which has been widely applied to weakly- and strongly compressible turbulence in astrophysics and engineering applications. We present a learn-able hierarchy of parameterized and "physics-explainable" Lagrangian based fluid simulators using both physics based parameters and Neural Networks (NNs) as universal function approximators. This hierarchy of parameterized Lagrangian models gradually introduces more SPH based structure, which we show improves interpretability, generalizability (over larger ranges of time scales and Mach numbers), preservation of physical symmetries (corresponding to conservation of linear and angular momentum), and requires less training data. Our learning algorithm develops a mixed mode approach, mixing forward and reverse mode automatic differentiation with local sensitivity analyses to efficiently perform gradient based optimization. We train this hierarchy on both weakly compressible SPH and DNS data, and show that our physics informed learning method is capable of: (a) solving inverse problems over the physically interpretable parameter space, as well as over the space of NN parameters; (b) learning Lagrangian statistics of turbulence (interpolation); (c) combining Lagrangian trajectory based, probabilistic, and Eulerian field based loss functions; (d) extrapolating beyond training sets into more complex regimes of interest; (e) learning new parameterized smoothing kernels better suited to weakly compressible DNS turbulence data.},

@article{Okraschevski2022,
   abstract = {In this work we will identify a novel relation between Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) and explicit Large Eddy Simulation (LES) using a coarse-graining method from Non-Equilibrium Molecular Dynamics (NEMD). While the current literature points at the conclusion that characteristic SPH issues become restrictive for subsonic turbulent flows, we see the potential to mitigate these SPH issues by explicit subfilter stress (SFS) modelling. We verify our theory by various simulations of homogeneous, isotropic turbulence (HIT) at $Re=10^4$ and compare the results to a Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) reported by Dairay et al. (2017). Although the simulations substantiate our theory, we see another issue arising, which is conceptually rooted in the particle itself, termed as Particle Duality. Finally, we conclude our work by acknowledging SPH as coarse-graining method for turbulent flows, highlighting its capabilities and limitations.},
