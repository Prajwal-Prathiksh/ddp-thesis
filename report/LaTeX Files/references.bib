Vortical structures and time-averaged velocity profiles in the wake are compared with numerical computations from a previously developed inviscid, unsteady panel code that utilizes a nonlinear wake model. Qualitative and quantitative comparisons are excellent over a broad range of reduced frequencies and Strouhal numbers, indicating that the formation and evolution of the thrust-indicative wake structures are primarily inviscid phenomena. Results at Strouhal numbers greater than about 1.0 (based on plunge amplitude) demonstrate nonsymmetric, deflected wake patterns, where both an average thrust and an average lift are produced.

Results were compared with experimental measurements in the literature and those from an inviscid analytical method and an unsteady panel method code. Although the peak in propulsive efficiency with Strouhal number demonstrated in the experimental results was predicted by the inviscid methods, it was found to be significantly modified by leading-edge vortex shedding and viscous drag at low Strouhal numbers. The occurrence and influence of vortex shedding is controlled by both the motion of the airfoil (amplitudes and phases of plunging and pitching) and the flapping frequency, which limits the time available for vortex formation and convection over the airfoil surface. Thus, Strouhal number alone is insufficient to characterize the efficiency of flapping-foil propulsion.},

The experiments were conducted in a low-speed wing tunnel with a miniaturized piezoelectric wing (i.e., chord length, C = 12.7 mm) flapping at a frequency of 60 Hz (i.e., f = 60 Hz). The non-dimensional parameters of the flapping wing are chord Reynolds number of Re = 1,200, reduced frequency of k = 3.5, and non-dimensional flapping amplitude at wingtip h = A/C = 1.35. The corresponding Strouhal number (Str) is 0.33, which is well within the optimal range of 0.2 {\textless} Str {\textless} 0.4 used by flying insects and birds and swimming fishes for locomotion. A digital particle image velocimetry (PIV) system was used to achieve phased-locked and time-averaged flow field measurements to quantify the transient behavior of the wake vortices in relation to the positions of the flapping wing during the upstroke and down stroke flapping cycles. The characteristics of the wake vortex structures in the chordwise cross planes at different wingspan locations were compared quantitatively to elucidate underlying physics for a better understanding of the unsteady aerodynamics of flapping flight and to explore/optimize design paradigms for the development of novel insect-sized, flapping-wing-based NAVs. {\textcopyright} 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

We test the hypothesis of the optimality of C-start of larval fish by simulations of larval-shaped, two-and three-dimensional self-propelled swimmers. We optimize for the distance travelled by the swimmer during its initial bout, bounding the shape deformation based on the larval mid-line curvature values observed experimentally. The best motions identified within these bounds are in good agreement with in vivo experiments and show that C-starts do indeed maximize escape distances. Furthermore we found that motions with curvatures beyond the ones experimentally observed for larval fish may result in even larger escape distances. We analyse the flow field and find that the effectiveness of the C-start escape relies on the ability of pronounced C-bent body configurations to trap and accelerate large volumes of fluid, which in turn correlates with large accelerations of the swimmer. {\textcopyright} 2012 Cambridge University Press.},

This review is focused on assessing the recent progress in numerical techniques of solving animal swimming and flight problems. According to the complexity of the problems considered, numerical studies are classified into five stages, of which the main characteristics and the numerical strategies are described and discussed.

We show that anguilliform swimmer shapes enable the trapping and subsequent acceleration of regions of fluid transported along the entire body by the midline travelling wave. A sensitivity analysis of the optimal morphological traits identifies that the width thickness in the anterior of the body and the height of the caudal fin are critical factors for both speed and efficiency. The fastest swimmer without a caudal fin, however, still retains 80{\%} of its speed, showing that the entire body is used to generate thrust. The optimal shapes share several features with naturally occurring morphologies, but their overall appearances differ. This demonstrates that engineered swimmers can outperform biomimetic swimmers for the criteria considered here. {\textcopyright} 2013 Cambridge University Press.},

These force formulas hold individually for each airfoil thus allowing for force decomposition, and the contributions to forces from singularities (such as bound and image vortices, sources, and doublets) and bodies out of an airfoil are related to their induced velocities at the locations of singularities inside this airfoil. The force contribution due to vortex production is related to the vortex production rate and the distance between each pair of vortices in production, thus frameindependent. The formulas are validated against a number of standard problems. These force formulas, which generalize the classic Kutta-Joukowski theorem (for a single bound vortex) and the recent generalized Lagally theorem (for problems without a bound vortex and vortex production) to more general cases, can be used to identify or understand the roles of outside vortices and bodies on the forces of the actual body, optimize arrangement of outside vortices and bodies for force enhancement or reduction, and derive analytical force formulas once the flow field is given or known.},

	abstract = {A fundamental understanding of how various biological traits and features provide organisms with a competitive advantage can help us improve the design of a number of mechanical systems. Numerical optimization can play an invaluable role for this purpose, by allowing us to scrutinize the evolution of specific biological adaptations in nature. Importantly, the use of numerical optimization can help us overcome limiting constraints that restrict the evolutionary capability of biological species. We capitalize on these advantages by coupling high-fidelity simulations of self-propelled swimmers with evolutionary optimization algorithms, to examine peculiar swimming patterns observed in a number of fish species. More specifically, we investigate the intermittent form of locomotion referred to as 'burst-And-coast' swimming, which involves a few quick flicks of the fish's tail followed by a prolonged unpowered glide. This mode of swimming is believed to confer energetic benefits, in addition to several other advantages. We discover a range of intermittent-swimming patterns, the most efficient of which resembles the swimming behaviour observed in live fish.We also discover patterns which lead to a marked increase in swimming-speed, albeit with a significant increase in energy expenditure. Notably, the use of multi-objective optimization reveals locomotion patterns that strike the perfect balance between speed and efficiency, which can be invaluable for use in robotic applications. As an additional goal of the paper, we highlight the ease with which disparate codes can be coupled via the software framework used, without encumbering the user with the details of efficient parallelization and machinelearning based task-scheduling.},

	abstract = {Computational scientists have investigated swimming performance across a multitude of different systems for decades. Most models depend on numerous model input parameters and performance is sensitive to those parameters. In this article, parameter subspaces are qualitatively identified in which there exists enhanced swimming performance for an idealized, simple swimming model that resembles a Caenorhabditis elegans, an organism that exhibits an anguilliform mode of locomotion. The computational model uses the immersed boundary method to solve the fluid-interaction system. The 1D swimmer propagates itself forward by dynamically changing its preferred body curvature. Observations indicate that the swimmer's performance appears more sensitive to fluid scale and stroke frequency, rather than variations in the velocity and acceleration of either its upstroke or downstroke as a whole. Pareto-like optimal fronts were also identified within the data for the cost of transport and swimming speed. While this methodology allows one to locate robust parameter subspaces for desired performance in a straight-forward manner, it comes at the cost of simulating orders of magnitude more simulations than traditional fluid-structure interaction studies.},

	abstract = {Fish form schools because of many possible reasons. However, the hydrodynamic mechanism whereby the energy efficiency of fish schools is improved still remains unclear. There are limited examples of fish models based on actual swimming movements using simulation, and the movements in existing models are simple. Therefore, in this study, we analyzed the swimming behavior of Biwa salmon (Oncorhynchus sp., a salmonid fish) using image analyses and formulated its swimming motion. Moreover, computational fluid dynamics analysis was carried out using the formulated swimming motion to determine the fluid force acting on the fish body model with real fish swimming motion. The swimming efficiency of the fish model under parallel swimming was obtained from the calculated surrounding fluid force and compared for different neighboring distances. The flow field around the fish model was also examined. The swimming efficiency of two fish models swimming parallelly was improved by approximately 10{\%} when they were separated by a distance of 0.4L, where L is the total length of the model. In addition, the flow field behind the fish body was examined under both inphase and antiphase conditions and at inter-individual distances of 0.8L and 1.2L. The apparent flow speed in the distance range of 0.5-2.0L from the midpoint of the snouts of the two individuals was lower than the swimming speed. The pressure distribution on the fish model showed an elevated pressure at the caudal fin. Interestingly, we obtained an isopleth map similar to that of a caudal peduncle. To avoid a negative thrust, the aft part of the body must be thin, as shown in the isopleth map obtained in this study.},

	abstract = {The reverse vortex street differs from the ordinary Karman vortex street in the direction of the rotation of the vortices. Such a street is formed behind the oscillating airfoils in the flow. It is of interest in connection with studies of the aerodynamics of flapping wings. It is known that the vortex wake behind a symmetric airfoil performing symmetric oscillations in a certain range of parameters becomes asymmetric, which leads to the appearance of a nonzero average lift. Reasons of the symmetry violation are associated with the instability of the reverse vortex street, but the mechanism of this instability is currently not well understood. In this work, the analysis of the stability of the reverse vortex street is carried out on the basis of the theory developed by Karman for infinite rows of point vortices. In contrast to the Karman model, in this work, semi-infinite rows with periodically arising new vortices at their ends are considered. This is the first time this model has been used. It is shown that the periodic appearance of new vortices radically affects the characteristics of the street stability. It is found that the violation of the symmetry of the reverse vortex street is associated with its instability to bending perturbations, while the ordinary Karman vortex street behind the body is unstable to varicose perturbations. Regions of instability are determined.},

	abstract = {The separation point of the flow around a circular cylinder has been numerically and experimentally investigated in the regime of Reynolds number less than 280. The present results reveal that the long-existing discrepancy in the data concerning the time-averaged separation angles reported in the literature results mainly from the oscillating characteristics of the flow separation on the cylinder surface and the experimental methodologies rather than the commonly mentioned blockage-ratio effect. In the present experiment, the time-averaged separation angles are obtained by averaging the instantaneous images from a soap-film flow visualization instead of from the commonly used streakline images from finite time exposures. Excellent agreement has been achieved between the present experimental results and numerical simulations by the spectral element method. Particle-streak visualization in a towing tank has also been conducted to compare with that of the two-dimensional soap-film experiments. It reveals that the separation angle is insensitive to the three-dimensional effect. Variations of the time-averaged separation angles with Reynolds number can be represented by a four-term $\theta$s-Re-1/2 relationship in the range of 7 ≤ Re ≤ 200. Moreover, if the data in the very low Reynolds number region are excluded, a simple linear $\theta$s-Re-1/2 relationship can be derived for 10 ≤ Re ≤ 200. Since the dimensionless boundary layer thickness and the Strouhal-Reynolds number relationship for the circular cylinder are also known to be proportional to Re-1/2, this linear relationship offers direct evidence that the flow characteristics of the boundary layer extend downstream along the cylinder surface to the separation point in this Re-range. The blockage effect on the separation angle has also been quantitatively analysed. {\textcopyright} 2004 Cambridge University Press.},

@article{Liu2015,
	abstract = {This paper studies the lift and drag experienced by a body in a two-dimensional, viscous, compressible and steady flow. By a rigorous linear far-field theory and the Helmholtz decomposition of the velocity field, we prove that the classic lift formula L = $\rho$0U$\Gamma$$\phi$, originally derived by Joukowski in 1906 for inviscid potential flow, and the drag formula D = $\rho$0UQ$\psi$, derived for incompressible viscous flow by Filon in 1926, are universally true for the whole field of viscous compressible flow in a wide range of Mach number, from subsonic to supersonic flows. Here, $\Gamma$$\phi$ and Q$\psi$ denote the circulation of the longitudinal velocity component and the inflow of the transverse velocity component, respectively. We call this result the Joukowski-Filon theorem (J-F theorem for short). Thus, the steady lift and drag are always exactly determined by the values of $\Gamma$$\phi$ and Q$\psi$, no matter how complicated the near-field viscous flow surrounding the body might be. However, velocity potentials are not directly observable either experimentally or computationally, and hence neither are the J-F formulae. Thus, a testable version of the J-F formulae is also derived, which holds only in the linear far field. Due to their linear dependence on the vorticity, these formulae are also valid for statistically stationary flow, including time-averaged turbulent flow. Thus, a careful RANS (Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes) simulation is performed to examine the testable version of the J-F formulae for a typical airfoil flow with Reynolds number Re = 6.5 × 106 and free Mach number M ∈ [0.1, 2.0]. The results strongly support and enrich the J-F theorem. The computed Mach-number dependence of L and D and its underlying physics, as well as the physical implications of the theorem, are also addressed.},

abstract = {Unsteady inviscid flow models of wings and airfoils have been developed to study the aerodynamics of natural and man-made flyers. Vortex methods have been extensively applied to reduce the dimensionality of these aerodynamic models, based on the proper estimation of the strength and distribution of the vortices in the wake. In such modelling approaches, one of the most fundamental questions is how the vortex sheets are generated and released from sharp edges. To determine the formation of the trailing-edge vortex sheet, the classical steady Kutta condition can be extended to unsteady situations by realizing that a flow cannot turn abruptly around a sharp edge. This condition can be readily applied to a flat plate or an airfoil with cusped trailing edge since the direction of the forming vortex sheet is known to be tangential to the trailing edge. However, for a finite-angle trailing edge, or in the case of flow separation away from a sharp corner, the direction of the forming vortex sheet is ambiguous. To remove any ad hoc implementation, the unsteady Kutta condition, the conservation of circulation as well as the conservation laws of mass and momentum are coupled to analytically solve for the angle, strength and relative velocity of the trailing-edge vortex sheet. The two-dimensional aerodynamic model together with the proposed vortex-sheet formation condition is verified by comparing flow structures and force calculations with experimental results for several airfoil motions in steady and unsteady background flows.},
