    Turbulence modelling is a challenging problem, particularly for a Lagrangian method such as Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) which lacks the years of theoretical and practical research that conventional CFD solvers based on FEM/FVM enjoy.
    However, work based on translating existing Eulerian-based turbulence methods to SPH and Lagrangian-specific models has started making inroads in the general understanding of the topic in an SPH setting. Ultimately, a rigorous and robust model can be devised, which is suitable for a wide variety of $2D$ and $3D$ problems.
    
    This project aims to survey and review the state-of-the-art turbulence models that SPH offers and help subsequently provide a comparative analysis detailing the advantages and limitations of these models.
    It also intends to extend the best-equipped models to robust and accurate SPH schemes and incorporate some of the latest developments in the field of SPH to refine further the machinery required to model turbulence.
