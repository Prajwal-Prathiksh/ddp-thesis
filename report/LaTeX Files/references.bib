abstract = {Smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) was invented to simulate nonaxisymmetric phenomena in astrophysics (Lucy 1977, Gingold {\&} Monaghan 1977). We wanted a method that was easy to work with and could give reasonable accuracy. The SPH method satisfied these require- ments. As a bonus we found the SPH was rugged, gave sensible answers in difficult situations, and could be extended to complicated physics with- out much trouble. The SPH method is a particle method. Unlike the particle in cell method (PIC) (Harlow 1957, 1974, 1988), SPH does not need a grid to calculate spatial derivatives. Instead, they are found by analytical differentiation of interpolation formulae. The equations of momentum and energy become sets of ordinary differential equations which are easy to understand in mechanical and thermodynamical terms. For example, the pressure gradi- ent becomes a force between pairs of particles. The astrophysicist can then use intuition in a way which is difficult with the original partial differential equations. This intuition, coupled with detailed analysis, has allowed SPH to be extended to a wide variety of astrophysical problems. Although very accurate finite-difference methods exist-and these are better than SPH for some problems-they cannot handle complex physics in three dimensions with the same ease. Various aspects of SPH have been reviewed by Monaghan (1985, 1988a) and Benz (1988, 1989).},

   abstract = {In this paper an SPH version of the alpha turbulence model devised by Holm and his colleagues is formulated for compressible flow with a resolution that varies in space and time. The alpha model involves two velocity fields. One velocity field is obtained from the momentum equation, the other by averaging this velocity field as in the version of SPH called XSPH. The particles (fluid elements) are moved with the averaged velocity. In analogy to the continuum alpha model we obtain a particle Lagrangian from which the SPH alpha equations can be derived. The system satisfies a discrete Kelvin circulation theorem identical to that obtained with no velocity averaging. In addition, the energy, linear and angular momentum are conserved. We show that the continuum equivalent of the SPH equations are identical to the continuum alpha model, and we conjecture that they will have the same desirable features of the continuum modelincluding the reduction of energy in the high wave number modes even when the dissipation is zero. Regardless of issues concerning turbulence modelling, the SPH alpha model is a powerful extension of the XSPH algorithm which reduces disorder at short length scales and retains the constants of the motion. The SPH alpha model is simple to implement.},

Non-overtopping and overtopping of the breakwater by the incident wave were considered to compare different wave dissipation efficiencies. An incompressible Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) theory combined with a Large Eddy Simulation (LES) model was employed as the numerical tool. The SPH method is robust for tracking free surfaces without numerical diffusion and the LES model is capable of analyzing turbulence and eddy vortices during wave-breakwater interactions. A good agreement between computational and experimental wave profiles verifies the accuracy of the SPH-LES model. The computations also disclose that the wave energy dissipation is mainly attributed to the turbulence production and vortex shedding during the wave transmission and reflection processes.},

   abstract = {Context. Simulations of astrophysical turbulence have reached such a level of sophistication that quantitative results are now starting to emerge. However, contradicting results have been reported in the literature with respect to the performance of the numerical techniques employed for its study and their relevance to the physical systems modelled.Aims. We aim at characterising the performance of a variety of hydrodynamics codes including different particle-based and grid-based techniques on the modelling of decaying supersonic turbulence. This is the first such large-scale comparison ever conducted.Methods. We modelled driven, compressible, supersonic, isothermal turbulence with an rms Mach number of Mms̃4, and then let it decay in the absence of gravity, using runs performed with four different grid codes (ENZO, FLASH, TVD, ZEUS) and three different SPH codes (GADGET, PHANTOM, VINE). We additionally analysed two calculations denoted as PHANTOM A and PHANTOM B using two different implementations of artificial viscosity in PHANTOM. We analysed the results of our numerical experiments using volume-averaged quantities like the rms Mach number, volume-and density-weighted velocity Fourier spectrum functions, and probability distribution functions of density, velocity, and velocity derivatives.Results. Our analysis indicates that grid codes tend to be less dissipative than SPH codes, though details of the techniques used can make large differences in both cases. For example, the Morris \& Monaghan viscosity implementation for SPH results in less dissipation (PHANTOM B and VINE versus GADGET and PHANTOM A). For grid codes, using a smaller diffusion parameter leads to less dissipation, but results in a larger bottleneck effect (our ENZO versus FLASH runs). As a general result, we find that by using a similar number of resolution elements N for each spatial direction means that all codes (both grid-based and particle-based) show encouraging similarity of all statistical quantities for isotropic supersonic turbulence on spatial scales k≥N/32 (all scales resolved by more than 32 grid cells), while scales smaller than that are significantly affected by the specific implementation of the algorithm for solving the equations of hydrodynamics. At comparable numerical resolution (Nparticles≈ Ncells), the SPH runs were on average about ten times more computationally intensive than the grid runs, although with variations of up to a factor of ten between the different SPH runs and between the different grid runs.Conclusions. At the resolutions employed here, the ability to model supersonic to transonic flows is comparable across the various codes used in this study. © 2009 ESO.},

   abstract = {Direct evaluation of energy spectra in purely Lagrangian meshless methods is a challenging task. On the other hand, improvement of turbulence modeling in a Lagrangian framework relies strongly on our ability to estimate energy spectra up to the maximally resolved wavenumber. In this paper we compare different strategies to extract energy spectra from a velocity field defined on a scattered set of points. Spectra can be directly evaluated from irregularly distributed sample by using Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) and their regularized versions. Alternative procedures require a preliminary interpolation into a grid where, on a second stage, a Fourier analysis can be performed. As a last approach a Moving Least Squares (MLSs) technique for preliminary interpolation is investigated and the results are discussed. Although exhibiting good accuracy in the low-moderate wavenumber window, the first two strategies introduce unacceptable large errors in the near-maximal-resolved wavenumber, where the highest accuracy is often required. Here we propose a second-order Moving Least Squares (MLSs) scheme as an optimal tool that allows us to reproduce precisely the energy spectrum over the entire wavenumber window. We discuss the importance of this result with respect to the development of accurate turbulence models for purely Lagrangian meshless methods. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

   abstract = {This thesis investigates turbulent wall-bounded flows using the Smoothed Particle Hydro- dynamics (SPH) method. The first part focuses on the SPH method itself in the context of the Navier-Stokes equations with a special emphasis on wall boundary conditions. After dis- cussing classical wall boundary conditions a detailed introduction to unified semi-analytical wall boundary conditions is given where the key parameter is a renormalization factor that accounts for the truncated kernel support in wall-bounded flows. In the following chapter it is shown that these boundary conditions fulfill energy conser- vation only approximately. This leads to numerical noise which, interpreted as form of Brownian motion, is treated using an additional volume diffusion term in the continuity equation where it is shown to be equivalent to an approximate Riemann solver. Two exten- sions to the boundary conditions are presented dealing with variable driving forces and a generalization to Robin type and arbitrary-order interpolation. Two modifications for free- surface flows are then presented, one for the volume diffusion term and the other for the algorithm that imposes Robin boundary conditions. The variable driving force is validated using a Poiseuille flow and the results indicate an error which is five orders of magnitude smaller than with the previous formulation. Discretising the wave equation with Robin boundary conditions proves that these are correctly imposed and that increasing the order of the interpolation decreases the error. The two modifications for flows under the influence of external forces significantly reduce the error at the free-surface. Finally, a dam break over a wedge demonstrates the capabilities of all the proposed modifications. With the aim of simulating turbulent flows in channels, the thesis moves on to extending the unified semi-analytical wall-boundary conditions to three dimensions. The thesis first presents the consistent computation of the vertex particle mass. Then, the computation of the kernel renormalization factor is considered, which in 3-D consists of solving an integral over a two dimensional manifold where the smoothing kernel intersects the boundary. Us- ing a domain decomposition algorithm special integration areas are obtained for which this integral can be solved for the 5th-order Wendland kernel. This algorithm is successfully applied to several validation cases including a dam break with an obstacle which show a significant improvement compared to other approximative methods and boundary condi- tions. The second part of this thesis investigates turbulent flows, in particular turbulent channel flow. This test case is introduced in detail showing both the physical properties as well as established numerical methods such as direct numerical simulation (DNS) and large eddy simulation (LES). In the penultimate chapter several SPH simulations of the turbulent channel flow are shown. The first section deals with a quasi DNS of the minimal-flow unit, a channel flow with a minimal domain size to sustain turbulent flow structures. The Eulerian statistics are compared to literature and show good agreement except for some wall-normal quantities. Furthermore, preliminary Lagrangian statistics are shown and com- pared to results obtained from a mesh-based DNS. The final simulation shows a LES of a full-sized channel at Reynolds number Reτ = 1000. The Eulerian statistics are compared to literature and the discrepancies found are explained using simulations of the Taylor-Green vortex, indicating that the momentum is not transferred appropriately due to an unresolved velocity-pressure-gradient tensor.},

   abstract = {The turbulent flow field through complex geometric configurations involves interactions between wakes, von K´arm´an vortex streets and shear layers. The mechanisms involved in both vortex loss of coherence and vortex interaction with cylinders require the identification of vortexes themselves. One of the most promising techniques, especially for essentially two-dimensional structures, is based on the definition of Lagrangian Coherent Structures (LCS). SPH is a particularly attractive method for the study of LCS since the technique itself provides the motion of individual fluid particles. This eliminates the need for expensive post-processing inherent to Eulerian solutions. SPH solutions may resolve large turbulent scales, however, dynamics of small scales and dissipative effects must be modelled for high Re flows. The typically employed SPS strategy for LES simulations, based on the standard Smagorinsky model, has severe downsides such as inability to correctly enforce wall conditions and non-vanishing stresses with laminar flows. As an alternative, the wall-adapting local eddy viscosity (WALE) model is cast in SPH formalism and used to perform the simulations under DualSPHysics, retaining the high-performance of the implementation. The results are drawn from 2D LES simulations on a cylinder array at Re=550. They allow for a brief and exploratory characterization of the used SPH formulation (weakly compressible) regarding its ability to resolve the flow at kernel and sub-kernel scales. A complex LCS system is studied in detail, showing the life of a group of eddies as they undergo changes due to interactions with each other, background turbulence and the channel geometry.},

It is shown that the SPH smoothing procedure can be reinterpreted as a sort of LES Lagrangian filtering, and that, besides the terms coming from the LES convolution, additional contributions (never accounted for in the SPH literature) appear in the equations when formulated in a filtered fashion.

The model makes few assumptions, conserves linear and angular momentum, satisfies a discrete version of Kelvin's circulation theorem and is computationally efficient. Furthermore, the results from the model for decaying two dimensional turbulence are in good agreement with the experimental and computational results. The SPH turbulence model is based on a Lagrangian similar to that used for the Lagrangian averaged Navier-Stokes (LANS) turbulence model, but with a different smoothed velocity. The smoothed velocity preserves the shape of the spectrum of the unsmoothed velocity for short length scales, but reduces its magnitude by an amount which depends on a parameter $\epsilon$, where 0≤$\epsilon$≤1. When $\epsilon$=0, there is no smoothing, and when $\epsilon$=1 the smoothing is a maximum. We compare calculations with resolution given by the Reynolds length ℓR and those using SPH-$\epsilon$ with $\epsilon$=0.8, and a coarser resolution 2ℓR. The second and fourth order velocity correlation functions, the energy spectrum and the mixing calculated using SPH-$\epsilon$ and the coarse resolution 2ℓR, are in good agreement with those using the resolution ℓR, but requires 8 times less work to integrate to the same time. The mixing induced by the turbulence is in good agreement with high resolution calculations.},

   abstract = {In the present work the multi-phase SPH model presented in Grenier et al. (2009) is considered and extended through the inclusion of a diffusive term in the continuity equation. The latter based on the δ-SPH model of Antuono et al. (2012), allows to improve the evaluation of the pressure field, removing numerical noise and improving also the particles spatial distribution. The time stepping and the choice of the speeds of sound for the different phases are discussed, showing that this choice is driven not only by physical consideration but also by numerical constraints linked to the stability of the scheme. To this aim, comparisons are provided to a Riemann-SPH multi-phase model. In particular we show that the proposed δ-SPH multi-phase solver has a different stability region than its Riemann-SPH counterpart, allowing for bigger time steps for some density and speed of sound ratios, while in other conditions the Riemann-SPH multi-phase model is more convenient. A series of validating tests are carried out over different benchmarks widely used in the SPH literature. As a final test-case the water entry of a corrugated panel involving the entrapment of an air cavity is considered to show how the proposed multi-phase δ-SPH method is able to accurately treat complex water impact events.},

   abstract = {Smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) is a mesh-free Lagrangian method for obtaining approximate numerical solutions of the equations of fluid dynamics; which has been widely applied to weakly- and strongly compressible turbulence in astrophysics and engineering applications. We present a learn-able hierarchy of parameterized and "physics-explainable" Lagrangian based fluid simulators using both physics based parameters and Neural Networks (NNs) as universal function approximators. This hierarchy of parameterized Lagrangian models gradually introduces more SPH based structure, which we show improves interpretability, generalizability (over larger ranges of time scales and Mach numbers), preservation of physical symmetries (corresponding to conservation of linear and angular momentum), and requires less training data. Our learning algorithm develops a mixed mode approach, mixing forward and reverse mode automatic differentiation with local sensitivity analyses to efficiently perform gradient based optimization. We train this hierarchy on both weakly compressible SPH and DNS data, and show that our physics informed learning method is capable of: (a) solving inverse problems over the physically interpretable parameter space, as well as over the space of NN parameters; (b) learning Lagrangian statistics of turbulence (interpolation); (c) combining Lagrangian trajectory based, probabilistic, and Eulerian field based loss functions; (d) extrapolating beyond training sets into more complex regimes of interest; (e) learning new parameterized smoothing kernels better suited to weakly compressible DNS turbulence data.},

While the current literature points at the conclusion that characteristic SPH issues become restrictive for subsonic turbulent flows, we see the potential to mitigate these SPH issues by explicit subfilter stress (SFS) modelling. We verify our theory by various simulations of homogeneous, isotropic turbulence (HIT) at $Re=10^4$ and compare the results to a Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) reported by Dairay et al. (2017). Although the simulations substantiate our theory, we see another issue arising, which is conceptually rooted in the particle itself, termed as Particle Duality. Finally, we conclude our work by acknowledging SPH as coarse-graining method for turbulent flows, highlighting its capabilities and limitations.},

abstract = {We review the properties of the nonlinearly dispersive Navier-Stokes-alpha (NS-$\alpha$) model of incompressible fluid turbulence - also called the viscous Camassa-Holm equations in the literature. We first re-derive the NS-$\alpha$ model by filtering the velocity of the fluid loop in Kelvin's circulation theorem for the Navier-Stokes equations. Then we show that this filtering causes the wavenumber spectrum of the translational kinetic energy for the NS-$\alpha$ model to roll off as k-3 for k$\alpha$ {\textgreater} 1 in three dimensions, instead of continuing along the slower Kolmogorov scaling law, k-5/3, that it follows for k$\alpha$ {\textless} 1. This roll off at higher wavenumbers shortens the inertial range for the NS-$\alpha$ model and thereby makes it more computable. We also explain how the NS-$\alpha$ model is related to large eddy simulation (LES) turbulence modeling and to the stress tensor for second-grade fluids. We close by surveying recent results in the literature for the NS-$\alpha$ model and its inviscid limit (the Euler-$\alpha$ model). {\textcopyright} 2001 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.},

We focus on fundamental aspects, using mainly data from direct numerical simulations capable of great detail and precision when specific accuracy requirements are met. Differences between time evolution in Eulerian and Lagrangian frames illustrate the dominance of advective transport. We examine basic results in Kolmogorov similarity, giving an estimate of an inertial-range universal constant and the grid resolution and Reynolds number needed to attain the requisite scaling range of time lags. The Lagrangian statistics of passive scalars are discussed in view of current efforts in model development, with differential diffusion between multiple scalars being characterized by shorter timescales. We also note the need for new data in more complex flows and in other applications where a Lagrangian viewpoint is especially useful.},

Two different decaying turbulence cases at moderate and high Reynolds numbers are studied. In statistically stationary turbulence two different forcing techniques are implemented to model the energetics of the energy-containing scales. The resolved flows are examined by comparison of the energy spectra of the LANS-$\alpha$ with the DNS computations. The energy transfer and the capability of the LANS-$\alpha$ equations in representing the backscatter of energy is analyzed by comparison with the DNS data. Furthermore, the correlation between the vorticity and the eigenvectors of the rate of the resolved strain tensor is studied.

abstract = {A dynamic procedure for the Lagrangian-averaged Navier-Stokes-$\alpha$ (LANS-$\alpha$) equations is developed where the variation in the parameter $\alpha$ in the direction of anisotropy is determined in a self-consistent way from the data contained in the simulation itself. In order to derive this model, the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations are Helmholtz filtered at the grid and test filter levels. A Germano-type identity is derived by comparing the filtered subgrid-scale stress terms with those given in the LANS-$\alpha$ equations. Assuming constant $\alpha$ in homogenous directions of the flow and averaging in these directions result in a nonlinear equation for the parameter $\alpha$, which determines the variation of $\alpha$ in the nonhomogeneous directions or in time. Consequently, the parameter $\alpha$ is calculated during the simulation instead of a predefined value. The dynamic model is initially tested in forced and decaying isotropic turbulent flows where $\alpha$ is constant in space but it is allowed to vary in time. It is observed that by using the dynamic LANS-$\alpha$ procedure a more accurate simulation of the isotropic homogeneous turbulence is achieved. The energy spectra and the total kinetic-energy decay are captured more accurately as compared with the LANS-$\alpha$ simulations using a fixed $\alpha$. In order to evaluate the applicability of the dynamic LANS-$\alpha$ model in anisotropic turbulence, a priori test of a turbulent channel flow is performed. It is found that the parameter $\alpha$ changes in the wall normal direction. Near a solid wall, the length scale $\alpha$ is seen to depend on the distance from the wall with a vanishing value at the wall. On the other hand, away from the wall, where the turbulence is more isotropic, $\alpha$ approaches an almost constant value. Furthermore, the behavior of the subgrid-scale stresses in the near-wall region is captured accurately by the dynamic LANS-$\alpha$ model. The dynamic LANS-$\alpha$ model has the potential to extend the applicability of the LANS-$\alpha$ equations to more complicated anisotropic flows. {\textcopyright} 2005 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {We compute solutions of the Lagrangian-Averaged Navier-Stokes alpha-model (LANS) for significantly higher Reynolds numbers (up to Re 8300) than have previously been accomplished. This allows sufficient separation of scales to observe a Navier-Stokes (NS) inertial range followed by a 2nd LANS inertial range. The analysis of the third-order structure function scaling supports the predicted l{\^{}}3 scaling; it corresponds to a k{\^{}}(-1) scaling of the energy spectrum. The energy spectrum itself shows a different scaling which goes as k{\^{}}1. This latter spectrum is consistent with the absence of stretching in the sub-filter scales due to the Taylor frozen-in hypothesis employed as a closure in the derivation of LANS. These two scalings are conjectured to coexist in different spatial portions of the flow. The l{\^{}}3 (E(k) k{\^{}}(-1)) scaling is subdominant to k{\^{}}1 in the energy spectrum, but the l{\^{}}3 scaling is responsible for the direct energy cascade, as no cascade can result from motions with no internal degrees of freedom. We verify the prediction for the size of the LANS attractor resulting from this scaling. From this, we give a methodology either for arriving at grid-independent solutions for LANS, or for obtaining a formulation of a LES optimal in the context of the alpha models. The fully converged grid-independent LANS may not be the best approximation to a direct numerical simulation of the NS equations since the minimum error is a balance between truncation errors and the approximation error due to using LANS instead of the primitive equations. Furthermore, the small-scale behavior of LANS contributes to a reduction of flux at constant energy, leading to a shallower energy spectrum for large alpha. These small-scale features, do not preclude LANS to reproduce correctly the intermittency properties of high Re flow.},

abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to develop a combined method for three-dimensional incompressible flow and heat transfer by the spectral collocation method (SCM) and the artificial compressibility method (ACM), and further to study the performance of the combined method SCM-ACM for three-dimensional incompressible flow and heat transfer. Design/methodology/approach: The partial differentials in space are discretized by the SCM with Chebyshev polynomial and Chebyshev-Gauss-Lobbatto collocation points. The unsteady artificial compressibility equations are solved to obtain the steady results by the ACM. Three-dimensional exact solutions with trigonometric function form and exponential function form are constructed to test the accuracy of the combined method. Findings: The SCM-ACM is developed successfully for three-dimensional incompressible flow and heat transfer with high accuracy that the minimum value of variance can reach. The accuracy increases exponentially along with time marching steps. The accuracy is also improved exponentially with the increasing of nodes before stable accuracy is achieved, while it keeps stably with the increasing of the time step. The central processing unit time increases exponentially with the increasing of nodes and decreasing of the time step. Research limitations/implications: It is difficult for the implementation of the implicit scheme by the developed SCM-ACM. The SCM-ACM can be used for solving unsteady impressible fluid flow and heat transfer. Practical implications: The SCM-ACM is applied for two classic cases of lid-driven cavity flow and natural convection in cubic cavities. The present results show good agreement with the published results with much fewer nodes. Originality/value: The combined method SCM-ACM is developed, firstly, for solving three-dimensional incompressible fluid flow and heat transfer by the SCM and ACM. The performance of SCM-ACM is investigated. This combined method provides a new choice for solving three-dimensional fluid flow and heat transfer with high accuracy.},

abstract = {In this paper, the Entropically Damped Artificial Compressibility (EDAC) formulation of Clausen (2013) is used in the context of the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) method for the simulation of incompressible fluids. Traditionally, weakly-compressible SPH (WCSPH) formulations have employed artificial compressiblity to simulate incompressible fluids. EDAC is an alternative to the artificial compressiblity scheme wherein a pressure evolution equation is solved in lieu of coupling the fluid density to the pressure by an equation of state. The method is explicit and is easy to incorporate into existing SPH solvers using the WCSPH formulation. This is demonstrated by coupling the EDAC scheme with the recently proposed Transport Velocity Formulation (TVF) of Adami et al. (2013). The method works for both internal flows and for flows with a free surface. Several benchmark problems are considered to evaluate the proposed scheme and it is found that the EDAC scheme gives results that are as good or sometimes better than those produced by the TVF or standard WCSPH. The scheme is robust and produces smooth pressure distributions and does not require the use of an artificial viscosity in the momentum equation although using some artificial viscosity is beneficial.},

@article{Chola2021,
abstract = {This paper presents a formulation of a general form of an equation for pressure using thermodynamic principles. The motivation for this is in large part due to the need for a pressure equation for smoothed particle hydrodynamics, SPH, that takes into account the role of entropy. This is necessary because the use of physical and artificial viscosity leads to an increase in entropy. While such an increase in entropy in liquids may be negligibly small, standard SPH formulations treat a liquid as a weakly compressible gas. Consequently, for fluid-fluid and fluid-structure impact flows, the resulting increase in entropy is not negligible anymore. The proposed pressure equation contains diffusion terms whose main role is to smooth out unphysically large numerical oscillations in the pressure field related to the shock during an impact event. One consequence of adopting this numerical scheme, however, is that there are new (free) parameters that must be set. Nevertheless, effort has been made to obtain their plausible estimators from physical principles. The proposed model is also applicable outside the domain of SPH.},

@article{Clausen2013,
abstract = {An alternative artificial compressibility (AC) scheme is proposed to allow the explicit simulation of the incompressible Navier-Stokes (INS) equations. Traditional AC schemes rely on an artificial equation of state that gives the pressure as a function of the density, which is known to enforce isentropic behavior. This behavior is nonideal, especially in viscously dominated flows. An alternative, the entropically damped artificial compressibility (EDAC) method, is proposed that employs a thermodynamic constraint to damp the pressure oscillations inherent to AC methods. The EDAC method converges to the INS in the low-Mach limit, and is consistent in both the low- and high-Reynolds-number limits, unlike standard AC schemes. The proposed EDAC method is discretized using a simple finite-difference scheme and is compared with traditional AC schemes as well as the lattice-Boltzmann method for steady lid-driven cavity flow and a transient traveling-wave problem. The EDAC method is shown to be beneficial in damping pressure and velocity-divergence oscillations when performing transient simulations. The EDAC method follows a similar derivation to the kinetically reduced local Navier-Stokes (KRLNS) method [Borok, Phys. Rev. EPLEEE81539-375510.1103/PhysRevE.76.066704 76, 066704 (2007)]; however, the EDAC method does not rely on the grand potential as the thermodynamic variable, but instead uses the more common pressure-velocity system. Additionally, a term neglected in the KRLNS is identified that is important for accurately approximating the INS equations. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Physical Society.},

abstract = {The use of adaptive spatial resolution to simulate flows of practical interest using Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) is of considerable importance. Recently, Muta and Ramachandran [1] have proposed an efficient adaptive SPH method which is capable of handling large changes in particle resolution. This allows the authors to simulate problems with much fewer particles than was possible earlier. The method was not demonstrated or tested with moving bodies or multiple bodies. In addition, the original method employed a large number of background particles to determine the spatial resolution of the fluid particles. In the present work we establish the formulation's effectiveness for simulating flow around stationary and moving geometries. We eliminate the need for the background particles in order to specify the geometry-based or solution-based adaptivity and we discuss the algorithms employed in detail. We consider a variety of benchmark problems, including the flow past two stationary cylinders, flow past different NACA airfoils at a range of Reynolds numbers, a moving square at various Reynolds numbers, and the flow past an oscillating cylinder. We also demonstrate different types of motions using single and multiple bodies. The source code is made available under an open source license, and our results are reproducible.

Nature of problem: Simulating fluid flow around multiple moving bodies requires the local resolution to be automatically adapted in order to capture all the necessary flow features. If a single resolution is used throughout the domain, the number of particles would be excessively large. Solution method: We validate and demonstrate the accuracy of the adaptive particle refinement algorithm in simulating flow past moving multiple geometries. Our algorithm is fully parallel, and we provide an open-source implementation.},

In this paper, we perform a systematic numerical study of convergence and accuracy of kernel-based approximation, discretization operators, and weakly compressible SPH (WCSPH) schemes. We explore the origins of the errors and issues preventing second-order convergence despite having a periodic domain. Based on the study, we propose several new variations of the basic WCSPH scheme that are all second-order accurate. Additionally, we investigate the linear and angular momentum conservation property of the WCSPH schemes. Our results show that one may construct accurate WCSPH schemes that demonstrate second-order convergence through a judicious choice of kernel, smoothing length, and discretization operators in the discretization of the governing equations.},

In this paper, the particle inconsistency problem is investigated and some methods to improve the particle inconsistency are discussed. A new approach is proposed to restore the particle consistency. The new approach retains the conventional non-negative smoothing function instead of reconstructing a new smoothing function. A series of numerical studies have been carried out to verify the performance of the new approach.
